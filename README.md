Ionic + Firebase Seed App
=========================

![Logo](/www/img/starter-logo.png)

This is a seed application to help you get started building apps with [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) and Firebase. Using [AngularFire](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/angular/), this app implements email & password authentication and adds messages to a synchronized array. The app is built using the [Ionic CLI](http://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/).

## [Getting Started](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/ionic/guide.html)

First, replace `FBURL` with the URL of your own Firebase on line 4 in `/www/js/app.js`. To run this app you need to install the Ionic CLI. Run the following commands to get started:

```
npm install -g ionic
git clone git@github.com:sararob/ionic-seed.git
cd ionic-seed/
ionic serve
```

To see a side by side iOS and Android view of your app in the browser, run `ionic serve --lab` instead of `ionic serve`. Details on `ionic serve` can be found in the [Ionic docs](http://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/test.html).


## Running your app

You can run this app in the browser using the command `ionic serve`, or use `ionic serve --lab` to run it in the browser with a side by side iOS and Android view.

To configure your app for iOS or Android and run it in the emulator, follow the instructions in our [Ionic guide](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/ionic/guide.html).

## How it Works

Since Ionic is built on top of Angular, this seed application uses AngularFire.

#### Email & password authentication

This app makes use of Firebase's [email & password authentication](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/guide/login/password.html). To enable email & password auth, navigate to the "Login & Auth" tab in your Firebase app dashboard and select "Enable Email & Password Authentication".

Once it's enabled, you're ready to start creating and authenticating users in your app. You can create users with AngularFire's [`$createUser()`](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/angular/api.html#angularfire-users-and-authentication-createusercredentials) method, passing it an email and password. Then you'll use `$authWithPassword()` to log users in, and `$unauth()` to log users out. This app also makes use of `$onAuth` to check the user's authentication state and set `$scope.loggedInUser` to the current user.

Firebase also supports authentication with Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, Google, anonymous auth, and custom authentication. Check out the docs on user authentication for details on these authentication methods.

#### Adding messages to a synchronized array

This app uses the [`$firebaseArray`](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/angular/guide/synchronized-arrays.html) service to store message data in a synchronized array. Using `$firebaseArray`, our local Angular array is kept in sync with our remote Firebase data. To add items to `$firebaseArray`, use the $add() method. Check out the [AngularFire documentation](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/angular/guide/synchronized-arrays.html) for more details on how this works.

## Testing your app

### Unit tests

Unit tests can be found in `tests/Services/services.tests.js`. To run them, navigate to the `tests/` directory and run the command `karma start`. The tests check that both the `Auth` and `Messages` factories return `$firebaseAuth` and `$firebaseArray` respectively.

### End-to-end tests

End-to-end tests can be found in `e2e-tests/scenarios.js`. To run them, navigate to the `e2e/` directory and run the command `protractor protractor.conf.js`. The e2e tests check that the app loads correctly, logs users in, displays the messages list to logged in users, and adds a message to Firebase when the "Add" button is pressed.

## Securing your app

This seed app has two basic security rules. The first ensures that only logged in users can add messages to the list:

` ".write": "auth != null"`

The second rule ensures that new messages are not empty:

`".validate": "newData.hasChild('text')"`

`.validate` rules are run after `.write rules succeed. You can see the full rules in the `rules.json` file. If you're using Firebase Hosting to deploy your application, you can deploy your security rules file to Firebase by adding a `rules` parameter to your `firebase.json` file. Check out the [hosting documentation](https://www.firebase.com/docs/hosting/guide/full-config.html#section-advanced-properties) for details on configuring this.

For more details on security rules, check out the [security quickstart](https://www.firebase.com/docs/security/quickstart.html) in our documentation.

## Deploying your app

To publish your app in the iOS or Android app stores, follow the instructions in the [Ionic documentation](http://ionicframework.com/docs/guide/publishing.html).

You can use [Firebase Hosting](https://www.firebase.com/docs/hosting/) to deploy your app on the web in three steps:

#### 1. Install the Firebase command line tools

To install firebase-tools, run the command:

`npm install -g firebase-tools`

#### 2. Initialize your app

`cd` into your app directory and run the command:

`firebase init`

Then you'll be prompted to enter the name of the Firebase app you'd like to deploy. After selecting your app, enter `www/` as the current directory. This will tell Firebase Hosting to deploy your `www/` directory (which is where your `index.html` file lives) every time you deploy your app. You only ever need to run this init command once.

#### 3. Deploy your app

To deploy your app simply run:

`firebase deploy`

Your app will be deployed to `YOUR-APP-NAME.firebaseapp.com`. Custom domains are available for paid plans, and details on setting up custom domains can be found [here](https://www.firebase.com/docs/hosting/guide/custom-domain.html).
